This is a list of my public journal entries for each day after my Mom passed. These are intended to be informal as I'm just spilling out thoughts. I don't work on every journal entry the day they happen, so it's possible I forget things since everything feels so blurry.

## Completed Entries
* [Day 1](./day-1.md) (6-6-25)
* [Day 2](./day-2.md) (6-7-25)
* [Day 5](./day-5.md) (6-10-25)
