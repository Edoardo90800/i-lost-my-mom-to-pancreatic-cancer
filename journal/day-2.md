I'm still trying to process everything happening and play video games to keep my mind occupied (even though it doesn't work most of the time). I started working on this repository and asked my sister for pictures of my Mom and I. She sent hundreds of pictures of her in general and I found around 5 - 6 pictures of just me and her. She told me there are many more pictures she'll need to scan, though.

Pretty much all of these pictures are of her and me when I was a child. I took a lot of comfort in seeing them, but it's so weird since I don't remember a lot of them. It made me realize I didn't really have any pictures of her and me in the last few years. This is a huge regret now looking back, but we weren't big picture takers later on in life. There were pictures we had taken at holiday events, I just never received them personally.
